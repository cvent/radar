Cvent has several mono-repositories like (nucleus, carina, nx, mono-java and other mini mono repositories for various products)</p>"
Monoliths,Hold,Techniques,FALSE,"<p>Monoliths is an architectural pattern that normally involves a single application artifact and code repository. All development happens on the same artifact and the artifact gets deployed as a single unit. This is often a very efficient method for deliverying software when there's a limited number of teams with limited complexity. As the # of teams grow and the complexity increases it starts to hurt productivity. There are many other tradeoffs with this architectural style. At Cvent we recommend moving towards the microservice architectural pattern</p>"
MS SQL Server,Hold,Platforms,FALSE,"<p>MS SQL Server is one of the largest databases we use at Cvent today and is the primary relational database used behind large parts of app.cvent.com and related components.

Prisma,Hold,languages-and-frameworks,FALSE,"<p>Prisma is an interesting ORM that works well with graphql + typescript but has several short comings when it comes to how it handles transactions and joins. Prisma also uses a sidecar process to execute queries that severely hinders observability tools like Datadog. The side car process complicates connection pooling and IAM authentication and the sql generated is un friendly to RDS Proxy making it an unsuitable tool for serverless deployments. The approach we've taken to handle IAM results in memory leaks. For this reason we’re putting this technology on Hold and looking for alternatives.</p>"

Single Page Applications,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"<p>Single Page Applications (or SPA) is an architectural pattern where you load an applications UI once and then mutate state of the application on the fly without reloading the application. This is normally done by having the UI make API calls to the backend to change state or retrieve new data. At Cvent, many of our ReactJS applications follow this pattern. Gmail is a good example of an external SPA</p>"
Site Designer,Adopt,languages-and-frameworks,FALSE,"<p>A framework for exposing customizable web applications to end users based on Nucleus</p>"
